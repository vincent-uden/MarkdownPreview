# Welcome to MarkdownPreview!
This is a program which renders a preview of a given markdown document using
python. Select a file through the file browser and press reload if any changes
are made to the document. Automatic reloading might be added in the future.

The program can also be started with the name of a file as an argument
and this will automatically load the file on startup.
